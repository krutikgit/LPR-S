# License Plate Recognition System (LPRS) 

Automated License Plate and Over-Speed Detection System

• Designed and developed an automated system that detects vehicle speed and, if over-speeding occurs, 
extracts & stores the license plate number of the vehicle to generate fine.

• Employed YOLOv5 for object detection, WPOD-NET & OpenCV for object localization and character 
segmentation, and Django & MySQL for developing a responsive User interface.

• Trained MobileNet, Xception, and ResNet50 models for character recognition, observing the highest 
accuracy of 90% (MobileNet); tested on manual dataset achieving an absolute error rate of 0.98 km/hr
